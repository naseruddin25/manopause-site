  <p class="lead">
    Harmful relationship patterns often develop gradually. What starts as occasional behavior becomes the norm, and it can be hard to see clearly when you're inside it. This library helps you identify specific patterns—not to label your partner, but to understand what's happening and decide how to respond.
  </p>

  <SafetyCallout type="info">
    Recognizing a pattern doesn't mean your relationship is doomed. Some patterns can be addressed with mutual effort. Others indicate deeper issues that may not be safe to address alone. Use this information to gain clarity about your situation.
  </SafetyCallout>

  <h2>How to Use This Library</h2>
  
  <p>
    Each pattern below includes what it looks like, how it affects you, and why it matters. As you read, consider:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which patterns feel familiar in your relationship?</li>
    <li>How frequently do these occur—occasionally or constantly?</li>
    <li>Are the patterns getting more intense over time?</li>
    <li>How do these patterns affect your wellbeing and sense of self?</li>
  </ul>

          Chronic suspicion erodes trust and intimacy. It creates an exhausting dynamic where you can never prove your innocence. No amount of transparency will satisfy someone determined to find fault.

        <h3>How It Affects You</h3>
        <p>
          Living under threat creates chronic anxiety and hypervigilance. You may feel trapped, unable to express your needs or make independent decisions. The fear of consequences keeps you compliant even when you're unhappy.

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy relationships involve negotiation and compromise, not threats. When someone consistently uses threats to get their way, it's a form of coercion—regardless of whether the threats are carried out.

          Adults in healthy relationships maintain individual privacy. Surveillance is about control, not love or safety. Technology-facilitated abuse is increasingly recognized as a serious form of domestic abuse.

          Without outside perspectives, it becomes harder to recognize what's normal. You lose the support system that could help you. Loneliness makes you more dependent on your partner, even if the relationship is harmful.

        <p>
          Issues never get resolved. You may feel desperate to restore connection, leading you to over-apologize or abandon your own needs. The uncertainty of when engagement will resume is itself distressing.

      <div class="pattern-insight">
        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Note: Sometimes stonewalling is a stress response (freeze) rather than intentional manipulation. The difference is often in the intent and pattern. Chronic, punitive stonewalling is harmful; overwhelm-based shutdown needs different support.

        <h3>How It Affects You</h3>
        <p>
          Without financial resources, leaving becomes practically difficult. You may feel trapped regardless of how bad things get. Financial abuse can have long-lasting consequences on credit, career, and security.

      <div class="pattern-insight">
        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Financial abuse is recognized as a form of domestic abuse. Having your own access to money and financial information is a basic right, not a privilege your partner grants.

        <h3>How It Affects You</h3>
        <p>
          Fear of losing your children can keep you trapped. Watching your children be put in the middle is additionally painful. The children themselves suffer significant harm from this dynamic.

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Children should never be weapons. This pattern causes lasting harm to children and is recognized in custody evaluations as a form of abuse. Document this behavior carefully.

  <h2>What to Do With This Information</h2>
  
  <p>
    Recognizing patterns is clarifying but can also be overwhelming. Here's how to proceed:
  </p>

  <div class="action-grid">
    <div class="action-card">
      <h3>If You Recognize a Few Patterns</h3>
      <p>
        Some patterns occur in many relationships, especially during stressful times. Consider whether these are occasional incidents or consistent dynamics. If occasional, couples work or individual support might help address them.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-card">
      <h3>If You Recognize Many Patterns</h3>
      <p>
        Multiple patterns, especially from the "severe" category, indicate significant problems. This goes beyond normal relationship challenges. Consider speaking with a professional individually (not couples counseling) to assess your situation.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="action-card">
      <h3>If You Feel Unsafe</h3>
      <p>
        Trust your instincts. If reading this made you realize you're in danger, please visit our <a href="/get-help">Get Help</a> page for resources. You don't have to figure this out alone.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <SafetyCallout type="safety">
    If multiple severe patterns are present, do NOT attempt to address them directly with your partner without professional guidance. Confrontation can escalate danger. Get individual support first.
